# GameIQ Changelog

## v3.0.0 - Versus Update (February 2026)

### New Games
- **Versus** - Two things compared on a hidden metric; pick which one wins. 5 rounds per day. 150+ curated comparisons across 12 categories (technology, geography, sports, science, food, entertainment, history, business, nature, space, pop culture, miscellaneous). Supports both "higher wins" and "lower wins" metrics.

### Changes
- **Pricecheck scoring simplified** — now 1 point per correct guess (was 1-5 tiered scoring)
- All 5 games now have 365 pre-generated puzzles (full year of daily content)
- Removed dead Blindspot code from the codebase

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Versus `higherWins` detection — "followers" no longer matches `/lower/` regex
- Fixed tied-value rounds in Versus (Patriots/Steelers, PS5/Xbox) replaced with non-tied comparisons
